+ Project summary: In this project, we develop an analysis about wine. First we get our data from ... and then is the exploratory data analysis part. In the EDA part, in addition to the original feature included in dataset, we also convert the description of each entry to 4 features that we can analysis in the proceeding steps. So our response variable is price, and we have other ... explanatory variables. After that we use two different algorithms,both unsupervised learning, KNN and SOM, to explore the relationship between the price of wine and our features.
